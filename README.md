HTML Recipes Project for 'The Odin Project'

This is the first project for 'The Odin Project'.
I am instructed to create an HTML index page with branching Recipe pages in order to learn HTML, how to use Links and pictures,
and put it all together in a readable format that is easy to follow and somewhat pleasant to the eyes.
